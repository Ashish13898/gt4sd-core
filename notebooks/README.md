# GT4SD notebooks

## requirements

Install requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**NOTE:** As of now (:eyes: on [issue](https://github.com/GT4SD/gt4sd-core/issues/31) for changes), some dependencies require installation from GitHub, so make sure they are installed, in case they are not simply run:

```sh
pip install -r ../vcs_requirements.txt
```

Create a dedicated kernel:

```sh
python -m ipykernel install --name gt4sd
```

Good to go :rocket:
