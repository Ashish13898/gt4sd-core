# MolecularAI Reinvent Code Explanation

The code for getting unique sample sequences, randomizing scaffolds, and generation of the dataset as well as the dataloader was taken from the original implementation of [Molecular Reinvent](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent) and can be found in the class [ReinventBase](/gt4sd/algorithms/conditional_generation/reinvent/reinvent_core/core.py) which is in the subdirectory **reinvent_core**.

We have a created a new function *get_dataloader* which is a modified version of the function *[run](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent/blob/982b26dd6cfeb8aa84b6d7e4a8c2a7edde2bad36/running_modes/lib_invent/rl_actions/sample_model.py#:~:text=def%20run(self%2C%20scaffold_list%3A%20List%5Bstr%5D)%20-%3E%20List%5BSampledSequencesDTO%5D%3A)* that returns an instance of the dataloader instead of the sampled sequences and it can be found in the [ReinventBase](/gt4sd/algorithms/conditional_generation/reinvent/reinvent_core/core.py) class.

Moreover, we have not included [BaseAction](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent/blob/982b26dd6cfeb8aa84b6d7e4a8c2a7edde2bad36/running_modes/lib_invent/rl_actions/sample_model.py#:~:text=class%20BaseAction(abc.ABC)%3A) as a parent class for the [ReinventBase](/gt4sd/algorithms/conditional_generation/reinvent/reinvent_core/core.py) where we have added all the functions of [Molecular Reinvent](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent).
